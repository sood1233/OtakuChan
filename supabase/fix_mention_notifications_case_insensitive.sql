-- Mentions weren't creating notifications when the @handle's casing
-- didn't exactly match the stored username (e.g. "@Marpe" typed
-- against a profile whose username is "marpe"). Every other username
-- lookup in this app is case-insensitive (profile.js, chat.js,
-- followlist.js, profilelists.js all use .ilike('username', uname)),
-- but the mention trigger was doing (or is assumed to be doing) an
-- exact-case match against profiles.username, so a differently-cased
-- @mention silently matched no one and no notification was inserted.
--
-- This replaces the mention-detection function with a version that:
--   - extracts @handles with the same pattern the client uses to
--     linkify them (js/common.js linkifyText(): @[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20})
--   - looks each one up case-insensitively (ilike, exact match — no
--     wildcards, so "marpe" matches "@Marpe"/"@MARPE"/"@marpe" alike)
--   - dedupes repeated mentions of the same person in one post
--   - skips mentioning yourself
--
-- ADJUST BEFORE RUNNING: this assumes a `notifications` table with
-- columns (user_id, actor_id, type, post_id, read, created_at) — the
-- columns js/notifications.js selects from. If your actual table
-- differs (extra NOT NULL columns, different column names), or if you
-- already have a same-named trigger/function doing more than mention
-- detection (e.g. combined with likes/replies), rename this function
-- before running so it doesn't overwrite something else — or paste me
-- your existing one and I'll patch it directly instead.
